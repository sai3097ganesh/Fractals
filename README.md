# What's up with fractals?
Fractals are amazing. I like the way my advisor used to explain: A circle is an infinitely smooth shape whereas fractals are invinitely sharp.

# A simple fractal generator
Turns out that fractals are incredibly simple to generate. All you need to do is to keep track of a collection of a point moving randomly. But the movement of the point is constrained, often controlled by a geometry. Let's take triangle for example.

- Consider take a triangle ABC and say you are standing somewhere inside this triangle. 
- Now you pick a corner A or B or C.
- March forward by half the distance between your current position and the choosen corner.
- Repeat  

This is what it looks like when you run the simulation:

What you see is called Serpinski triangle. What's happening is that basically the three points in 2D (the geometry) acting as a guide for the point that is wanting to move randomly.

Have you ever seem Mathematics springing into life? 

Take a look at this. 

I have no words to describe how elegant it is to create something that live with in our daily life but never fail to think further. 

Doing such simulations, truly gives the satisfaction of understanding a facet of how nature works. A curiosity to extend the effort to try and generate other artifacts of nature almost irresistably ensues. 

Along those lines, what are mathematical rules to generate a ourselves?

The next time you stare at a tree, we have more things to be fascinated about. Yes, hidden behind all such complexity there are a simple of rules that nature follows to create all the things we see around.

So the moral of the story is that the next time someone calls you to go out - be it a walk or a trek, please don't say no!
